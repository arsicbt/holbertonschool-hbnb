# 🌆 HBnB - My First Front-End Application

## 📖 About This Project

Welcome to my very first front-end project! This is the HBnB (Holberton AirBnB) application that I built as part of my journey at Holberton School. This project represents a huge milestone for me - it's the first time I've created a complete front-end interface that connects to a back-end API.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished here, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## 🌱 What I Learned

Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Building semantic, accessible web pages with modern styling
- **JavaScript**: Writing clean, functional code to handle user interactions
- **API Integration**: Making fetch requests to communicate with a back-end server
- **Responsive Design**: Creating layouts that work on different screen sizes
- **User Authentication**: Implementing login/logout functionality with tokens
- **Dynamic Content**: Updating the DOM based on user actions and API responses
- **Form Validation**: Ensuring user input is correct before submission
- **Error Handling**: Managing API errors gracefully and providing feedback to users

## 🚀 Features

### User Authentication
- Login page with secure token-based authentication
- Persistent login state using cookies/localStorage
- Logout functionality
- Protected routes that require authentication

### Places Listing
- Browse all available places/properties
- View detailed information for each place
- Filter and search functionality
- Dynamic rendering of place cards

### Add New Places
- Form to create new property listings
- Input validation for all fields
- Success/error feedback messages
- Automatic redirect after successful creation

### Reviews System
- View reviews for each place
- Add new reviews (authenticated users only)
- Rating system
- Timestamp display for reviews

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with Flexbox/Grid
- **Jinja**: Templates
- **JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure JS!
- **Fetch API**: For HTTP requests
- **REST API**: Communication with back-end services
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration


## 🎨 Design Approach

I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface that is:
- **Intuitive**: Easy to navigate even for first-time users
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessible**: Follows web accessibility best practices
- **Modern**: Clean design with thoughtful color schemes and spacing

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/holbertonschool-hbnb.git
   cd holbertonschool-hbnb
   ```

2. **Run the server**
    ```
    python3 backend/run.py
    ```
   - Use my server:
        Then visit http://localhost:5000


## 🌟 Challenges I Overcame

This project pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible:

1. **Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript**: Learning to work with Promises and async/await was challenging but incredibly rewarding
2. **API Integration**: Figuring out how to structure requests, handle responses, and manage errors
3. **State Management**: Keeping track of user authentication state across different pages
4. **Debugging**: Learning to use browser DevTools effectively to troubleshoot issues
5. **Cross-Origin Requests**: Understanding and solving CORS issues
